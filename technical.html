                <p id="p1">Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python
                    programming languages is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with
                    all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited
                    for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.

                <p id="p2">This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in
                    most efficient way, with the topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django,
                    Deep-Learning, etc.) with examples.
                    Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:</p>

                    <li id="list2">Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like
                        Java.Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes
                        them readable all the time.</li>

                <p id="s"> <a id="ss" href="#Python">Python</a> is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming
                    language. It was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in 1991 and further developed by the
                    Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax
                    allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.Python is a programming language
                    that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.There are two major Python
                    versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

                <p id="sam"><strong>Beginning with Python programming:</strong></p>
                <ol id="20">
                    <li><strong> Finding an Interpreter:</strong>
                        <p id="p9">Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and
                            run our programs. There are certain online interpreters like GeeksforGeeks Online Compiler
                            that can be used to run Python programs without installing an interpreter.</p>

                        <p id="p5"><strong>Windows:</strong> There are many interpreters available freely to run Python
                            scripts like IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes bundled with the Python
                            software downloaded from <a id="a1" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"></a>Python
                            Download</p>

                        <p id="w2"><strong>Linux:</strong> Python comes preinstalled with popular Linux distros such as
                            Ubuntu and Fedora. To check which version of Python you're running, type “python” in the
                            terminal emulator. The interpreter should start and print the version number.</p>

                        <p id="w1"> <strong>macOS:</strong> Generally, Python 2.7 comes bundled with macOS. You'll have
                            to manually install Python 3 from http://python.org/.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Writing our first program:</strong>
                        Just type in the following code after you start the interpreter.
                        <code>
                    <strong>Code:</strong>
                    print("Sameer")
                    <strong>Output:</strong>
                    Sameer
                    </code>

                        <p id="steps">Let's analyze the script line by line.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Line 1:</strong> [print(“Sameer”)] To print something on the console, print()
                            function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed (unlike in
                            C).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Note that in Python 2, “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used
                            without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with
                            parentheses.

                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on
                    code readability. It generally has small programs when compared to Java and C. It was founded in
                    1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing
                    languages in the world. Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the
                    python community is very active. It is used in many organizations as it supports multiple

                <p>A string is a sequence of characters that can be a combination of letters, numbers, and special
                    characters. It can be declared in python by using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple
                    quotes. These quotes are not a part of a string, they define only starting and ending of the string.
                    Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed. Each element of the string can be accessed
                    using indexing or slicing operations.</p>

            <article id="art4">
                <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store
                    multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each
                    element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element
                    of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
                    <br>
                    For simplicity, we can think of an array a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value
                    (let's say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by
                    simply knowing the count of the step they are on. Array can be handled in Python by a module named
                    array. They can be useful when we have to manipulate only a specific data type values. A user can
                    treat lists as arrays. However, user cannot constraint the type of elements stored in a list. If you
                    create arrays using the array module, all elements of the array must be of the same type.

                <p> Python Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are
                    standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. In this article, we will
                    look into different types of Python operators. </p>
                <ul id="ul1">
                    <li>OPERATORS: Are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.</li>
                    <li>OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p id="p11"><strong>PRECEDENCE:</strong></p>
                <ul id="ul2">
                    <li>P - Parentheses</li>
                    <li>E - Exponentiation</li>
                    <li>M - Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)</li>
                    <li>D - Division</li>
                    <li>A - Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)</li>
                    <li>S - Subtraction</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some
                    commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same
                    code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in
                    it over and over again. </p>
