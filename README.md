If you want to start your Web Developer Journey from scratch I recommend you to do the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course. This course is beginner friendly. Bonus You will get a completion certificate from FreeCodeCamp. In that course focus more on HTML, CSS(position, display); After that learn JS(Javascript). Then learn Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. I will recommend Tailwind CSS. After that learn NodeJS and ExpressJS. After that learn ReactJS and NextJS. Kept doing projects regularly.

Thank you..!
