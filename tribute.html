          <p>
            During the 2003 04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly
            progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five
            teams in a single campaign.

            On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a
            senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two
            years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause
            increased to €150 million.

          </li>
          <p>
            After two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an
            overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.
            Uponthe latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.
            Hesigned a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8
            million,becoming the club's highest-paid player.

            Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La
            Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2-1 goal with
            his chest. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA
            World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting
            margin in each trophy's history.

          <p>
            He received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored
            in a calendar year. As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the
            FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the

            Barcelona lost 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munchen. These matches
            gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's

            player.
